          	<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

            <p>This is a 50-page writing sample created through our project-based engineering management class, Technology Strategy. We took a large concept and found a host capapble of implementing it. We broke down the idea into its various components, such as macroeconomic/social environment, company assessment, market/demand environment, technological evnrionment, competitive environment, technology intelligence, product strategy, operational strategy, intellectual property strategy, project valuation, finances, and plan for implementation. My team and I worked to give life to the idea of implementing machine learning cyber security technology with IBM. The 50-page paper can be found in the links below.</p>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

           <p> Cyber security is a field that is undergoing major changes. Recent high profile attacks on companies such as J.P. Morgan, Sony, and Target have made headline news and are raising the concern of society over its most personal information. Traditional approaches to threat detection have been circumnavigated by the most skilled hackers. A more robust approach must be used to learn and identify malicious behavior on a network. We propose that machine learning will be the future of cyber security because machine learning algorithms can learn the behaviors of attackers, and also the behaviors of employees who unknowingly may harm a network.</p>

            <p>The demand for robust cyber security is huge, but the market has grown more competitive and will surely stay this way. To make a dent in the cyber security market we need to lead a well-funded R&D team of experienced cyber security analysts and talented software engineers in machine learning. Our product will be designed to continuously update with the latest information on cyber attacks, giving our clients the most up to date protection from threats. The challenge for us is designing this product relatively quickly (2-3 years) so that we have a chance to compete with those already in the market. We first hope to capture at least 10% of the cyber security market for commercial banks, bringing the company back a few billion dollars. </p>

            <p> We believe IBM is in a better position than its competitors to develop a revolutionizing cyber security system. Our data resources, machine learning and artificial intelligence expertise, and existing business relationships give us an advantage over other competitors in incorporating machine learning into advanced contextual network threat detection.</p>
