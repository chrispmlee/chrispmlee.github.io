          	<h2 class="section-heading"> Introduction</h2>

            <p>The Tennesee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) project was a semester-long student consulting project, in which my partner, Ryan Burke, and I worked with TDEC to resolve their issues with their current grants management system. We worked directly with upper-management and the lead of the granting department. We had weekly meetings, in which we presented our updates, performed interviews, and discussed our plan of action for the following week. At first, we dove into understanding their current system, finding the flaws and opportunties for improvement. Through further research, and interviews of stakeholders and clients, we offered our recommendations and a map for implementation. The project ended with a 60-page report documenting our findings, a timeline for implementation, final presentation to key-stakeholders, and a mock request for proposal for the grants management system. Working with TDEC was a great opportunity for us to work closely with an organization that upholds our values for the environment, and gave us real-world experience.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Project Scope</h2>

            <p>The goal of this improvement project is to streamline the grant issuance process at TDEC. These grants are important because they support projects that protect the environment and conserve resources. Currently, there are five main granting programs: waste reduction grants; recycling rebates, equipment and used oil grants; clean Tennessee Energy grants; Local Parks and Recreation Fund; and Recreational Trails Program. Currently, a client must work through the granting program specific to their need in order to receive approval and funding. In the fiscal year 2013-2014, TDEC grants provided approximately $24 million to more than 170 entities. The project must take into account both the external and internal needs, multiple processes of the granting divisions, and barriers to entry.<p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Summary of the problem to solution</span>

            <p>A primary measure of the success of our system will be the time it takes the system to receive a grant, review it, approve it, and then grant the money to the entity that requests it. Another aim is to improve the satisfaction of our customers, which we will measure through surveying. The shorter time to receive a grant will likely improve satisfaction; still, we want to make sure our customers are not doing any unnecessary work in the process of submitting documents for their grant proposal.<p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Research</h2>

            <p>The vision for this system is to have a centralized online service that serves as a grant management system. Under this system will be four branches: grants, fees, permits, and licenses. The current system has 5 main divisions that all have the four branches stated above. Clients should be able to file for grants online without needing to wait for someone on the other side. The online system will be intuitive and tailored to the preferences of the clients. The system should make the grant approval process shorter.<p>
